# Chronium

This is just a collection of Kotlin micro-apps to help me with managing my journal. I thought I'd separate these from the journal itself, so I could develop it in the open.

Currently, it has:
- An AI-powered journal summarizer
- A journal entry generator using [Karbon](https://github.com/thebrownfoxx/karbon)
